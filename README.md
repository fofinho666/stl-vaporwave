# STL Vaporwave
A drag and drop webapp to visualize STL in a cool way ðŸ˜Ž
## Requirements

We have the following dependences to run this project:

- [Go](https://golang.org/) v1.16 or above
- [Node.js](https://golang.org/) v14 or above

A `.env` file is also required inside the **backend folder**. Here's an example of it:
```bash
AUTH_USERNAME="admin"
AUTH_PASSWORD="admin"
GITHUB_TOKEN="token for the releases"
```
## Development

First we need to install it's dependencies. 
1. On the **frontend folder** run `npm i`
2. On the **backend folder** run `make install`
3. To run everything together with concurrently, on the root folder run `npm i`

To run the project in watch mode
- On the **frontend folder** run `npm run dev`
- On the **backend folder** run `make dev`
- To run everything together, on the root folder run `npm run dev`

## Building the project 

First, we need to build the latest frontend assets by running on the **frontend folder** `npm run build`.

Now we can build the project binary. On the **backend folder** run `make build`. The binary will be at `backend/bin/`.

**Note:** The binary will need the same `.env` file to run. Make sure that this is <ins>on the same directory were you are running the application</ins>.

## Release

To release the project into github, om the **backend folder** run the following commands:

```bash 
# update your repo
$ git fetch --all --tags

# check the latest tag
$ git describe --tags --abbrev=0

# create the new tag
$ git tag -a v<version> -m "<Release description>"

# push the new tag
$ git push --tags

# push the release files
$ make release  
```

This will create a **draft release**, go to github's releases and publish it.
